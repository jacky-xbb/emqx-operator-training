# Kubernetes Operator Overview

![:scale 40%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/Cshxs4.png)

- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): An Operator extends the Kubernetes API by creating a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD). This new resource will act like any built-in resource within Kubernetes, such as Pods or Services.
- Custom Controllers: The Operator deploys a custom controller that watches the state of the new custom resources. This controller is the main component of the Operator.
- Desired State Management: The Operator's controller continually compares the desired state of the custom resources (as defined by the user) with their current state in the system. If there's a difference, the Operator works to make the current state reflect the desired state.
- Automation of Tasks: Operators automate tasks related to the management of the application or service they're designed to handle. This could include deployment, scaling, backups, upgrades, and recovery from failures.
- Domain-Specific Knowledge: Operators encapsulate the domain-specific knowledge of running a particular software or service on Kubernetes. This means they can manage complex stateful applications, reducing the operational complexity for human operators.

# EMQX Operator Overview

![:scale 30%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/iTS91g.png)

Using EMQX Operator to deploy and manage EMQX on a Kubernetes cluster provides several benefits:

- Simplified Deployment: It simplifies deployment by automating the management, scaling, and configuration of EMQX clusters within a Kubernetes environment.
- Automatic Scaling: You can expand the EMQX cluster without interrupting your business to access more devices and carry more complex business.
- Listener adjustment: Adjusting the listener through the EMQX dashboard can automatically update without changing k8s-related configurations.
- EMQX Upgrading: By performing blue-green upgrades of EMQX, it can minimize the effect on business operations.
- EMQX Monitoring: It can monitor all metrics of the entire EMQX cluster through EMQX Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana.

# Service

**Introduction**

![:scale 60%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/FeGr74.png)

- It acts as an abstraction layer, decoupling the front-end (client) from the back-end (Pods), and providing a single entry point to access the Pods.
- Applications can rely on stable network endpoints regardless of the location or changes in the status of the Pods.
- It provides the ability for load balancing. It distributes incoming network traffic to multiple Pods, ensuring an even distribution of the workload.

---

# Service

**Lables**

![:scale 60%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/sZawkE.png)

To establish a connection between Services and Pods that should route traffic, Services use label selectors. Label selectors act as filters, specifying which Pods should be included in the routing configuration of the Service.

The loose coupling between Services and Pods is achieved through labels and label selectors.

---

# Service

**Endpoints**

![:scale 50%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/AkFvG9.jpg)


- Provide a stable network address for the Service: Endpoint provides a stable network address for the Service, allowing other services or clients to access the Service through this address.
- Dynamically manage the network connections of backend Pods: Endpoint dynamically manages the network connections of backend Pods associated with the Service. When the status of a Pod changes (such as creation, deletion, or update), Endpoint will update the associated network connections accordingly.
- Load balancing: Endpoint can distribute requests among multiple backend Pods based on the load balancing strategy of the Service, achieving load balancing.
- Service discovery: Endpoint provides a mechanism for service discovery, allowing other services or clients to automatically discover and connect to the backend Pods of the Service.

# Liveness and readiness

```shell
Liveness:       http-get http://:dashboard/status delay=60s timeout=1s period=30s
Readiness:      http-get http://:dashboard/status delay=10s timeout=1s period=5s
```

- Liveness Probe: This checks whether the container is running or not.
- Readiness Probe: This checks whether the container is ready to serve requests or not.

In short, the liveness probe is used to know when to restart a container, and the readiness probe is used to know when a container is able to start receiving and serving traffic.

# License Configuration

- Create a license file(only v1beta4)
```shell
kubectl create secret generic ${your_license_name} --from-file=emqx.lic=${/path/to/license/file}
```

- For v1beta4
```shell
spec:
  license:
    secretName: ${your_license_name}
```

- For v2beta1
```shell
spec:
  config:
    data: |
      license {
        key = "..."
      }
```
The license.key in the config.data field represents the License content.

---

# License update

- For v1beta4
```shell
kubectl create secret generic ${your_license_name} --from-file=emqx.lic=${/path/to/license/file} --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

- For v2beta1
Modify spec.conf.data.license

- check if the license has been updated
```shell
kubectl exec -it ${emqx_pod_name} -c emqx -- emqx_ctl license info
```

---

# Enable TLS in EMQX

**Create a secret with TLS certificate**
```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: emqx-tls
type: kubernetes.io/tls
stringData:
  ca.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  tls.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  tls.key: |
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

ca.crt indicates the content of the CA certificate, tls.crt indicates the content of the server certificate, and tls.key indicates the content of the server private key


---

# Enable TLS in EMQX

**Configure in CR (Custom Resource)**

- For v1beta4
```shell
spec:
  template:
    spec:
        emqxConfig:
          listener.ssl.external.cacertfile: /mounted/cert/ca.crt
          listener.ssl.external.certfile: /mounted/cert/tls.crt
          listener.ssl.external.keyfile: /mounted/cert/tls.key
          listener.ssl.external: "0.0.0.0:8883"
          listener.ssl.external.gc_after_handshake: "true"
          listener.ssl.external.hibernate_after: 5s
        volumeMounts:
          - name: emqx-tls
            mountPath: /mounted/cert
      volumes:
        - name: emqx-tls
          secret:
            secretName: emqx-tls
```
The .spec.template.spec.volumes field configures the volume type as: secret, and the name as: emqx-tls

---

# Enable TLS in EMQX

**Configure in CR (Custom Resource)**

- For v2beta1
```shell
spec:
  image: emqx:5.1
  config:
    data: |
      listeners.ssl.default {
        bind = "0.0.0.0:8883"
        ssl_options {
          cacertfile = "/mounted/cert/ca.crt"
          certfile = "/mounted/cert/tls.crt"
          keyfile = "/mounted/cert/tls.key"
          gc_after_handshake = true
          handshake_timeout = 5s
        }
      }
  coreTemplate:
    spec:
      extraVolumes:
        - name: emqx-tls
          secret:
            secretName: emqx-tls
      extraVolumeMounts:
        - name: emqx-tls
          mountPath: /mounted/cert
  replicantTemplate:
    spec:
      extraVolumes:
        - name: emqx-tls
          secret:
            secretName: emqx-tls
      extraVolumeMounts:
        - name: emqx-tls
          mountPath: /mounted/cert
```

---

# Modify EMQX Configuration

apps.emqx.io/v2beta1 EMQX supports configuring EMQX cluster through .spec.config.data field

```shell
spec:
   image: emqx:5.1
   imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   config:
      data: |
         listeners.tcp.test {
            bind = "0.0.0.0:1884"
            max_connections = 1024000
         }
```

```shell
$ kubectl exec -it emqx-core-0 -c emqx -- emqx_ctl listeners
 ...
 tcp:test
   listen_on: 0.0.0.0:1884
   acceptors: 16
   proxy_protocol : false
   running: true
   current_conn: 0
   max_conns : 1024000
```

---

# Configure Persistence

- For v1beta4
EMQX 4.x cluster persistence through persistent field

```shell
spec:
  persistent:
    metadata:
      name: emqx-ee
    spec:
      storageClassName: standard
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 20Mi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
```

- For v2beta1
EMQX 5.x cluster Core node persistence through volumeClaimTemplates field

```shell
spec:
  image: emqx:5.1
  coreTemplate:
    spec:
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        storageClassName: standard
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 20Mi
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
      replicas: 3
```

When the user configures the .spec.persistent or .spec.coreTemplate.spec.volumeClaimTemplates field, EMQX Operator will mount the /opt/emqx/data directory in the EMQX container to StorageClass in the PV and PVC created, when the EMQX Pod is deleted, the PV and PVC will not be deleted, so as to achieve the purpose of saving EMQX runtime data.

# Configure Blue-Green Upgrade

![:scale 60%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacky-xbb/pics/main/uPic/5gBNP5.png)

1. Create a new group of pods (yellow) and add them to the existing pods (blue) in the EMQX cluster.
2. After the new cluster is ready, redirect the service to the new cluster and remove the old cluster from the service. At this time, the new cluster starts to receive traffic, and existing connections in the old cluster are not affected.
3. Use EMQX node evacuation function to evacuate connections on each node one by one.
4. Gradually scale down the old cluster to 0 nodes.
5. Complete the upgrade.


---

# Configure Blue-Green Upgrade

- For apps.emqx.io/v1beta4
only support EmqxEnterprise
```shell
spec:
  blueGreenUpdate:
    initialDelaySeconds: 60
    evacuationStrategy:
      waitTakeover: 5
      connEvictRate: 200
      sessEvictRate: 200
```

- For app.emqx.io/v2beta1
```shell
spec:
  updateStrategy:
    evacuationStrategy:
      connEvictRate: 1000
      sessEvictRate: 1000
      waitTakeover: 10
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
```


```
initialDelaySeconds: The waiting time before the start node is evacuated after all nodes are ready (unit: second).
waitTakeover: The time to wait for the client to reconnect and take over the session after all connections are disconnected (unit: second).
connEvictRate: MQTT client evacuation rate (unit: count/second).
sessEvictRate: MQTT Session evacuation speed (unit: count/second).
```

---

# Configure Blue-Green Upgrade

- Check the status of Blue-green

```shell
$ kubectl get emqx emqx-ee -o json | jq ".status.nodEvacuationsStatus"

[
  {
    "connection_eviction_rate": 200,
    "node": "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-54fc496fb4-2.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
    "session_eviction_rate": 200,
    "session_goal": 0,
    "connection_goal": 22,
    "session_recipients": [
      "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-5d87d4c6bd-2.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
      "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-5d87d4c6bd-1.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
      "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-5d87d4c6bd-0.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local"
    ],
    "state": "waiting_takeover",
    "stats": {
      "current_connected": 0,
      "current_sessions": 0,
      "initial_connected": 33,
      "initial_sessions": 0
    }
  }
]
```

```
connection_eviction_rate: Node evacuation rate (unit: count/second).
node: The node being evacuated currently.
session_eviction_rate: Node session evacuation rate (unit: count/second).
session_recipients: Session evacuation recipient list.
state: Node evacuation phase.
```

Make sure the Rebalance task is complete:

```shell
$ kubectl get emqx
NAME      STATUS   AGE
emqx-ee   Ready    8m33s
```

# Configure Load Rebalancing

**Purposes**

- Improve system scalability: In MQTT, connections don't auto-migrate to new nodes during scaling. To counter this, use load rebalancing to transfer connections from overloaded to new nodes. This ensures balanced load distribution across the cluster, improving throughput, response speed, and resource utilization.
- Reduce O&M costs: In clusters with uneven load distribution, load rebalancing can automatically adjust the workload, balancing tasks across nodes. This process enhances work distribution, reducing operational and maintenance costs.

---

# Configure Load Rebalancing

**Steps**

1. Add new EMQX nodes
2. Create a Rebalace CR
3. Apply the CR

A CR example

```shell
apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v1beta4
kind: Rebalance
metadata:
   name: rebalance-sample
spec:
   instanceName: emqx-ee
   instanceKind: EmqxEnterprise
   rebalanceStrategy:
     connEvictRate: 10
     sessEvictRate: 10
     waitTakeover: 10
     waitHealthCheck: 10
     absConnThreshold: 100
     absSessThreshold: 100
     relConnThreshold: "1.1"
     relSessThreshold: "1.1"
```

we can ignore the instanceKind field when it's v2beta1


---


# Configure Load Rebalancing

**Check the status of Rebalancing**

```shell
kubectl get rebalances rebalance-sample -o json | jq '.status.rebalanceStates'
{
     "state": "wait_health_check",
     "session_eviction_rate": 10,
     "recipients":[
         "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-3.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
     ],
     "node": "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-0.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
     "donors":[
         "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-0.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
         "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-1.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
         "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-2.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local"
     ],
     "coordinator_node": "emqx-ee@emqx-ee-0.emqx-ee-headless.default.svc.cluster.local",
     "connection_eviction_rate": 10
}
```

Make sure the Rebalance task is complete
```shell
$ kubectl get rebalances rebalance-sample
NAME               STATUS      AGE
rebalance-sample   Completed   62s
```

**Persistence**

- If you need persistence, you have to configure Storage Class
- If persistence is enabled, you need to configure podSecurityContext
```yaml
podSecurityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 1000
    fsGroup: 1000
    fsGroupChangePolicy: Always
    supplementalGroups:
      - 1000
```

---

# AWS

**Load Balancer**

- Ensure aws-load-balancer-controller has been installed
- Configuration annotations
```yaml
metadata:
  ## More content: https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/guide/service/annotations/
  annotations:
    ## Specifies whether the NLB is Internet-facing or internal. If not specified, defaults to internal.
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
    ## Specify the availability zone to which the NLB will route traffic. Specify at least one subnet, either subnetID or subnetName (subnet name label) can be used.
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: subnet-xxx1,subnet-xxx2
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ## More content: https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/guide/service/nlb/
    loadBalancerClass: service.k8s.aws/nlb
```

---

# AWS

**Terminate TLS Encryption With LoadBalancer**

- Import relevant certificates in AWS Console
- Add some annotations in EMQX custom resources' metadata
```yaml
## Specifies the ARN of one or more certificates managed by the AWS Certificate Manager.
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:xxxxx:certificate/xxxxxxx
## Specifies whether to use TLS for the backend traffic between the load balancer and the kubernetes pods.
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp
## Specifies a frontend port with a TLS listener. This means that accessing port 1883 through AWS NLB service requires TLS authentication,
## but direct access to K8S service port does not require TLS authentication
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "1883"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Check Kubernetes event**

Events are occurrences of specific things related to objects in your Kubernetes cluster, like errors, state changes, or other system messages.
```shell
kubectl get events
```

**Ensure cert-manger is installed**
```shell
$ kubectl pod -n cert-manager
```
The command output should look something like the following:
```shell
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
cert-manager-776649d6c6-vprcz              1/1     Running   0               53d

**How does a cluster contain multiple instances of EMQX?**

You can use different names to create them

```shell
apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v2beta1
kind: EMQX
metadata:
  name: ${emqx-name}
```

**How do you scale a running cluster that has been deployed with an Operator?**

You can modify .spec.coreTemplate.spec.replicas or replicantTemplate.spec.replicas to scale them.
